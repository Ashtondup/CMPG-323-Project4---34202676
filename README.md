## Discription of how the UiPath reports will be used 
This project is about using RPA to automize the workflow of using a the given database by using softwares or robots. The RPA tool that I will be using is UiPath.

UiPath is used to extract data, application transfer, report generation, and website testing. These are all exampels of web automation using UiPath.
